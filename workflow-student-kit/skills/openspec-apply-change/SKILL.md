## Host compatibility

Use the host's available question and progress tools; `AskUserQuestion`,
`TodoWrite`, and `Task` below are procedural roles, not required tool names.
If unavailable, ask directly, track progress in text, and perform the work
locally. Delegate only when authorized. Resolve artifact paths from the
installed OpenSpec CLI; fields such as `planningHome`, `artifactPaths`, and
`actionContext` may be project extensions. If absent, inspect the CLI
instructions and actual change paths rather than inventing values.


Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

Read the current project's `AGENTS.md` for tool routing, authority, and model
choice. Read Toolbox only for the needed command. Use the existing owner and
one acceptance-driven slice at a time; `tdd` includes the implementation design
check formerly in `implement`. Keep run/review evidence in existing evidence
records; link it from design/tasks rather than appending logs to design.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx:apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, and `actionContext`: planning scope and edit constraints
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID -> array of concrete file paths (varies by schema - could be proposal/specs/design/tasks or spec/tests/implementation/docs)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, use openspec-propose to complete the missing artifacts of the selected change without creating a duplicate
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

   **Workspace guard:** If status JSON reports `actionContext.mode: "workspace-planning"` and `allowedEditRoots` is empty, explain that full workspace apply is not supported in this slice. Treat linked repos and folders as read-only context, ask the user to select an affected area through an explicit implementation workflow, and STOP before editing files.

4. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

Read the **Architecture-aware OpenSpec** section of `workflow.md` bundled
with the available `grill-with-docs` skill and apply its implementation checks. Resolve that
skill through the current skill catalog; do not assume a repository-local
installation or invoke its interview for already-settled decisions.

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

6. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - For behavior-changing work, invoke `/tdd` before implementation; if it is not applicable, record why and run the narrowest relevant validation
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

7. **Review completed work**

   After all task checkboxes are complete:
   - Confirm a fixed point for the change; ask the user if it cannot be inferred from the change context
   - Invoke `/code-review` against that fixed point
   - If the review finds defects, return to the affected task and do not report implementation complete

8. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

### Completed This Session
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
...

All tasks complete! Ready to archive this change.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered
<description of the issue>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Do not report implementation complete until applicable TDD or narrow validation and code review have completed
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
